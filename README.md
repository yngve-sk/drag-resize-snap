## LWW - LightWeight Window

#### Tiny, simple JS library to create and manage multiple windows.

Demo: https://rawgit.com/yngve-sk/lww.js/master/demo-v2/index.html

Note: The text area inside the windows contain the configuration JSON object to get the window in its current state. Disregard the containerHandles in the config - these are calculated and does not need to be specified at all in the initial config.

#### installation:

    npm install lww.js

#### Usage/API:

TODO, see demo/ to see how it is used.

#### Contibuting:
 Contributions + bug reports/fixes are very welcome, the source code is (hopefully) pretty straight forward. The code is divided into only 3 classes, and most of the code in window class is purely boilerplate.
