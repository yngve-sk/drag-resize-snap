  "description": "A lightweight javascript windowing library with no external dependencies. Provides a few basic operations: Resize, collapse, close and maximize. This library is primarily meant for being able to spawn a window with arbitrary content - I.E it works best as being nothing but a wrapper around some content you only want to show at certain times. Built on https://github.com/arctelix/drag-resize-snap",
